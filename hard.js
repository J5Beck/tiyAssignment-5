// Consider the following code fragment

var a = "3";
var b = 2;
var c = b + a;


// Q: What is the value of c?  23


// Write to the best if your understanding
// why c is the value that it is.  a is a string and b is a value; So in var c - it's joining 2 plus the string 3 to make 23.



var str = "Version " + 5 + 1;


// Q: What is the value of str? Version 51


// Write to the best if your understanding -  Due to the string it will only join together
// why str is the value that it is. How could
// it be altered to result in 6 instead of 51?

var str = "Version " + (5 + 1);
